# MscThesis

This experiment is set to study the extent to which information that is no longer relevant enters the decision-making process. In particular, I am interested in the effect of sunk-costs resulting from an initial decision to engage in a project and the information about the unchosen project option (counterfactual), on the probability of investing additional funds in the chosen project.

The apps and pages of the experiment are sequenced as follows:

1. Intructions: 
 - Introduction
 - Consent
 - Instructions

2. InvestTask
  - Project_selection
  - Project_continuation
  - Results

3. Questionnaire
  - Justification
  - Demographics

4. EndPage
