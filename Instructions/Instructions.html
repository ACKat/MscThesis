    <h5> The Experiment </h5>
    <p>
        <h6> Stage 1: Project selection </h6> 
        You will be provided with an initial endowment and presented with two alternative projects. You will be asked 
        to choose the project you would like to invest in. At this stage you are basically making a <strong> random choice </strong>,
        as all the relevant information regarding costs and potential revenues will become available to you at the following stage. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <h6> Stage 2: Project continuation </h6> 
        At this stage, you will be informed about the investment cost you have incurred and the revenue gained as a result of 
        your initial investment choice. Moreover, you will be informed about the estimated probablity of success of your chosen 
        project. There is a chance that information regarding the probablity of success of the forgone project option will become
        also available. You will be asked to decide whether you want to finalize your chosen project by making 
        an additional investment or to abandon it and keep your endowment as it has been shaped up to that point.
    </p>

    <h5> Project details </h5>
    <p> 
        Your initial endowment is <strong> $ 10 </strong>. 
        <br>
        The <strong> intial investment cost can be either high or low </strong> and may exceed your initial endowment.
        However, the <strong> revenue buffer </strong> will guarantee that <strong> under no circumstances will you 
        end up with a negative balance </strong>. Its distribution is the same for both projects and places
        a 50% probability at each value. Regarding the probability of success, it may take two equally likely values: 
        <strong> 25% or 75% </strong>.
    </p>

    <h5> Your payoff </h5>
    <p>
        <h6> If you choose to adandon the project: </h6> 
        <p>
            Payoff = initial endowment - initial investment cost + revenue buffer 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h6>If you choose to carry on with the project: </h6>
        <p> 
            Payoff = initial endowment - initial investment cost + revenue buffer - additional investment cost +
            probability of sucess * revenue 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        You will be informed about the outcome of your investment right after making your choice at 
        Stage 2. After the required sample is gathered, 10 participants will be payed their payoff in addition to their 
        participation fee.<br>
        <br>
        Chances are high, so make sure your decision at the second stage represents your true preferences!
