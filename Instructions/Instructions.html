    <h5> The Experiment </h5>
    <p>
        <h6> Stage 1: Project selection </h6> 
        You will be provided with an <strong> initial endowment </strong> and presented with <strong> two alternative projects</strong>.
        You will be asked to choose the project you would like to invest in. At this stage you are basically making a <strong> random choice</strong>,
        as all the relevant information regarding costs and potential revenues will become available to you at the following stage. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <h6> Stage 2: Project continuation </h6> 
        At this stage, you will be informed about the investment cost you have incurred (<strong>initial investment cost</strong>) and the revenue gained as a result of 
        your initial investment choice (<strong>intermediate revenue</strong>). Moreover, you will be informed about the probability of success of both
        your chosen and perhaps your unchosen project option. You will be asked to<strong> decide whether you want to finalize your chosen project by making 
        an additional investment </strong> or to abandon it and keep your endowment as it has been shaped up to that point (<strong>current balance</strong>).
    </p>

    <h5> Project details </h5>
    <p> 
        Your initial endowment is <strong> $10</strong>. 
        <br>
        The <strong> intial investment cost can be either high or low </strong> and may exceed your initial endowment.
        However, the <strong>intermediate revenue</strong> will guarantee that <strong> under no circumstances will you 
        end up with a negative balance</strong>. <br>
        <br>
        The probability of project success can be either <strong>25% or 75%</strong>. <br>
        Both values for the initial investment cost and the probability of success are equally likely to occur. 
    </p>

    <h5> Your payoff </h5>
    <p>
        <h6> If you choose to <strong>abandon the project</strong>: </h6> 
        <p>
            Expected payoff = Initial endowment - Initial investment cost + Intermediate revenue
        </p>
        <br>
        <h6>If you choose to <strong>carry on with the project</strong>: </h6>
        <p> 
            Expected payoff = Initial endowment - Initial investment cost + Intermediate revenue - Additional investment cost +
            Probability of project success * Additional revenue 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        You will be informed about the outcome of your investment right after making your choice at 
        Stage 2. After the required sample is gathered,<strong> 5 participants</strong> will be payed their payoff in addition to their 
        participation fee.<br>
        <br>
        Chances are high, so make sure your decision represents your true preferences!
